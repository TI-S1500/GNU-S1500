Record of changes made to the GNU Assembler:

10/17/90  clm   - fixed the 'L' problem where symbols beginning 
 with capital 'L' were being converted to '_L' to prevent     
 confusion with local labels.  That created a problem when    
 these objects were linked with objects not compiled with GNU 
 and so didn't have the '_' feature.  Fix is to remove the 
 '_' at the end of assembly before writing out the symbols.   
 At that point all the symbol's information is correct, and    
 changing the name has no affect.  We must take the shortened
 symbols into account as we calculate string_byte_count for
 the string table.  Modified functions symbol_new, symbol_find
 and write_object_file.  Added function L_symbol_p (used to 
 parse symbols to see if they begin with 'L' after an unknown
 number of '_' characters).


12/17/90  clm   - added handling for the #ident C directive.  This creates
 a comment section in the object file using the .ident assembler directive.
 Changes were made to files: read.c, write.c and coff.h.
