Fixed problem causing core dump when trying to print doubles using 
format options.  Problem arose because code was using the function 
unpack_long on doubles, causing an overflow condition with doubles
larger than LONG_MAX.  Changed the code so that only the function
unpack_double is used on doubles, and to signal an error if the
user should try to print a double using any of the integer format 
args.
