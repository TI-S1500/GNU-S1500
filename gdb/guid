  Bob,
 
  Tom Plum gave me the final version of his C++ Guideline at the ANSI C++
  (X3j16) meeting. I am sending a paper copy and an electronic copy to you
  via TI internal mail. I suggest that we use the new version instead of the
  old Guideline and modify it.
 
  Also, I am sorry that I was unable to attend the last C++ guideline meeting.
  But I am still available for any committee work. I will like to volunteer
  for chapter 2 for C++ Guide line. But, I will not be able to meet the deadline
  of December 15 to make all the modifications, because I will on vacation
  from December 1 - December 30. I will finish my modifiactions by January 15.
  Let me know if that is a problem. And I will be present on the next C++ 
  guideline subcommittee meeting.
 
  Please let me know what you think about the using the final version of Tom
  Plum's Guideline.
 
  Regards,
